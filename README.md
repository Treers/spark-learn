Inputs:
- S is the training set,  
- L is a classification learning algorithm,  
- C is a cost matrix,  
- m is the number of resamples to generate,  
- n is the number of examples in each resample,  
- p is True iff L produces class probabilities,  
- q is True iff all resamples are to be used for each example

Procedure MetaCost (S, L, C, m, n, p, q)

For i = 1 to m
- Let S<sub>i</sub> be a resample of S with n examples.
- Let M<sub>i</sub> = Model produced by applying L to S<sub>i</sub>.

For each example x in S
- For each class j  
  - Let P(j|x) = \frac{1}{$\sum_{i}$}
